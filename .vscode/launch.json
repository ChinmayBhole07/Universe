To run the program using the provided `launch.json` configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Prerequisites**:
    - Install the [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) extension in Visual Studio Code.
    - Make sure Chrome is installed on your system.

2. **Start Your Application**:
    - If you're using a local server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`), ensure it is running before debugging.

3. **Open the Debug Panel**:
    - In Visual Studio Code, click on the Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or press `Ctrl+Shift+D`).

4. **Select a Configuration**:
    - From the dropdown at the top of the Debug panel, select either:
      - `Attach to Chrome` (if you want to attach to an already running Chrome instance with debugging enabled).
      - `Launch Chrome against localhost` (if you want to launch Chrome and open `http://localhost:8080`).

5. **Start Debugging**:
    - Click the green play button or press `F5` to start debugging.

6. **For `Attach to Chrome`**:
    - Ensure Chrome is running with remote debugging enabled. You can start Chrome with the following command:
      ```bash
      chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
      ```
    - Then attach to the running instance.
